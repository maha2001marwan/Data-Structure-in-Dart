# Data Structures Challenges in Dart

This repository contains solutions to several foundational coding challenges using **Stacks** and **Linked Lists** in Dart. These exercises help strengthen understanding of core data structure manipulation techniques.

## Overview

The challenges are grouped into two main categories:

- **Stacks**
- **Linked Lists**

Each solution is written in clean, readable Dart code, and is easy to test and extend.

## Challenges

### Stacks

#### Challenge 1: Reverse a List
Create a function that prints the contents of a list in reverse order.

#### Challenge 2: Balance the Parentheses
Given a string, check if the parentheses `(` and `)` are balanced. Return `true` if they are properly matched.

---

### Linked Lists

#### Challenge 1: Print in Reverse
Create a function that prints the nodes of a linked list in reverse order.

#### Challenge 2: Find the Middle Node
Create a function that finds and returns the middle node of a linked list.

#### Challenge 3: Reverse a Linked List
Create a function that reverses a linked list by manipulating the node connections.

#### Challenge 4: Remove All Occurrences
Create a function that removes **all** occurrences of a specific element from a linked list.

## Structure

Each challenge is implemented in its own Dart file or as a function inside a structured Dart project. The main file demonstrates how to call and test each function.

## How to Run

Make sure you have the Dart SDK installed.

```bash
dart run
